Program 3: - Develop a Django app that displays current date and time in server
To create a Django app that displays the current date and time from the server, follow these steps: 

Create a Django Project using the following command: 

django-admin startproject myproject 
 
Create a Django App: Inside your project directory, create a Django app using the following command: 

python manage.py startapp myapp 
 

Define a View Function: Open the views.py file in your app directory (myapp/views.py) and define a view function to handle the request and return the current date and time. 
Use Python's datetime module for this: 

python 

from django.http import HttpResponse 
from datetime import datetime 
 
def current_datetime(request): 
    now = datetime.now() 
    html = "<html><body>Current date and time: {0}</body></html>".format(now) 
    return HttpResponse(html) 
 

Map URL to View: Next, map the URL to the view function you just created. Open the urls.py file in your app directory (myapp/urls.py) and define a URL pattern: 

python 

from django.urls import path 
from . import views 
 
urlpatterns = [ 
    path('current_datetime/', views.current_datetime, name='current_datetime'), 
] 
 

Configure URL Mapping: Include the URL configuration of your app in the project's URL configuration. 
Open the urls.py file in your project directory (myproject/urls.py) and include the URL pattern of your app: 

python 

from django.contrib import admin 
from django.urls import path, include 
 
urlpatterns = [ 
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls), 
    path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')), 
] 
 

Run the Server: Start the Django development server using the following command: 

python manage.py runserver 
 

Access the Page: Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/current_datetime/ to see the current date and time displayed on the page. 

That's it! You have created a Django app that displays the current date and time from the server. 
You can further customize the HTML template to enhance the appearance of the page if needed. 

Program 4: - Develop a Django app that displays date and time four hours ahead and four hours before as
an offset of current date and time in server.
